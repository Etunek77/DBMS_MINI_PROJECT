### Admin Responsibilities:
- Admins are responsible for creation of objects of type Cities, Theatres and Movies using the Django Admin Interface. 
- Creation of a theatre automatically creates 4 objects (2d, 3d, 4dx, imax) in Hall class having that theatre as forein key.
- Shows are what the user sees while booking a movie. Each show has its own set of seats in the form of a JSONField which are automatically generated during object creation.
